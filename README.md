## Comparison to drizzle-orm (old):
    - Don't like usage of decorators in typeorm. Class variables are more readable imho. If you have to add a lot of different properties to typeorm column decorator stack can grow quite big.
    - Requirment of third party import (reflect-metadata) is not good feature also.
