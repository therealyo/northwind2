## Opinion on knex: 
- Migration api does not create sql script for schema creation. It uses method calls to create schema. 
- SQL queries parser is not perfect. For example it does not parse mulitplication symbol (*);
- It is easy to get started with knex because all queryBuilder methods look like native sql.
