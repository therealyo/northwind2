## Comparison to other ORMs:
- Powerfull migration system and overall schema declaration with type generation from cli. Easy to create schema from existing database.
- Absence of query builder. Syntax of calls has nothing in common with classic sql syntax, so various function call and arguments can be non-intuitive
- Nested calls in queries can make them grow big and hard to follow.
